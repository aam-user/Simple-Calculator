## Simple Arithmetic Calculator in C

A basic command-line calculator written in **C**. This project demonstrates the use of modular functions to perform fundamental arithmetic operations.

### 🛠 Features

* **Modular Logic:** Each operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division) is handled by its own dedicated function.
* **Safety Check:** Includes a specific check to prevent **division by zero**, avoiding program crashes.
* **Type Casting:** Demonstrates how to convert integers to floats for accurate division results.
* **Bilingual UI:** Prompts and outputs are in **Italian**.

### 📐 Operations Included

* `somma`: Addition of two integers.
* `sott`: Subtraction of two integers.
* `molt`: Multiplication of two integers.
* `div`: Division with floating-point result.

### 🚀 How to Run

1. Compile the code using GCC:
```bash
gcc calculator.c -o calculator

```


2. Run the executable:
```bash
./calculator
